### Some information

#### React is a Javascript library for creating user interfaces whose objective is to minimize errors using components (parts of the code). It uses a syntax called JSX which is very similar to HTML but they are not the same. There are many ways to use React, but one of the easiest is with the [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) platform which installs some packages and creates files for you.
